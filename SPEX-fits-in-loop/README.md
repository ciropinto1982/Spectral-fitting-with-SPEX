# SPEX fits performed in loop

This is a work-in-progress directory containing codes to perform SPEX fits in loop.

- SPEX_AMOL_fitting_routine.sh shows an example of running in loop different combinations of spectral models containing molecular and dust absorption (AMOL model in SPEX).

- SPEX_fit_spectra_loop.sh is a versatile example to fit spectra from different observations (and store all results in 1 ASCII file table)
