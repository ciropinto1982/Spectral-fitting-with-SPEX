# Tutorial for SPEX basic spectral fits

This is a work-in-progress directory that contains simple example of how to perform basic spectral fits with SPEX.

- "SPEX_fit_example_NGC55ULX1.com" is a complete and comprehensive tutorial that will teach you, from scratch, how to fit the X-ray spectrum (e.g. XMM/EPIC-pn) of a bright X-ray source, such as the ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 55 ULX-1, testing several continuum and plasma models. Ad-hoc examples and exercises will guide you through the basic steps of the broadband modelling, to testing progressively more complex continuum models. If you are new to SPEX, this is what you're looking for!

- "SPEX_fit_example_XRB.com" shows how to fit the X-ray spectrum (e.g. XMM/EPIC-pn) of a bright X-ray source, such as an X-ray binary or ULX found in a nearby (2 Mpc) galaxy, assuming a powerlaw continuum corrected for redshift and interstellar absorption. Additional steps and exercises are shown in order to test more complex continuum models.

- "SPEX_fit_example_SS.com" shows how to fit the high-resolution grating spectrum (e.g. XMM/RGS or Chandra/HETGS-LETGS) of a bright X-ray source, such as nova or another supersoft source, assuming a blackbody continuum corrected for redshift and interstellar absorption + plasma models of photoionised (wind-like) and collisionally ionised (shocked) ejecta. On this GitHub there's a full tutorial on this.

- "SPEX_plot_transmission.sh" is a simple SPEX script that defines several absorbers applied to a flat powerlaw and compute their individual transmission. PYTHON is then called to read the SPEX's output QDP/ASCII files and plot each transmission in one single PNG file.
